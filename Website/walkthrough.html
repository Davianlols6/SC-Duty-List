            <p>You can navigate the app by switching between "Home" and "Settings" in the navigator bar on the bottom part of your screen.</p>
            <h5>Home Page</h5>
            <p>On the home page, you will see 2 input fields. The input field on the left is called the "Date input" while the input field on the right is called the "Mode selector".</p>
            <p>By default, on start up, the Date input should show the current date while the Mode selector should show "Overview"</p>

            <p>The third and final option is "Always use Dark Mode". If you select this option, the app will always use dark mode.</p>
